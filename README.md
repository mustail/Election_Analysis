# Election_analysis
Python project to summarize election results.

## Project overview
This project aims to assist Tom, a Colorado Board of Elections employee, to audit tabulated elections results for a Colorado US Congress district.

The objectives are:
* find the total number of votes cast
* list all the candidates that received votes
* determine the number of votes each candidate received
* calculate the percentage of votes for each candidate
* identify the winner of the election

## Resources
This project is based on the tabulated data found in the CSV file "election_results.csv".
The code relies on two dependencies: *_csv_* and *_os_*.
The code was compiled using the IDE Visual Studio Code on Python version 3.8.5.

## Summary
This quick analysis found that there are three candidates that received votes, all of whom are listed below with their votes in order of the number of votes:
1. Diana DeGette : 73.8% (272,892)
2. Charles C. Stockham : 23% (85,213)
3. Raymon A. Doane : 3.1% (11,606)

The total number of votes counted in this election was 369,711.
